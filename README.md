Hello World! ðŸ˜Š

My name is Pedro and I am a recent MS student from the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at the Ohio State University. I'm a software engineer interested in iOS development, user interface, and user experience.

In my free time I mostly play video games, do small side project (that will change soon!), eat bread, and vent about the cold.
